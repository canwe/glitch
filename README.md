glitch
======

An image glitcher in golang.

Initially this is a more-or-less direct port of http://www.airtightinteractive.com/demos/js/imageglitcher/ while I'm learning Go, but when I'm more confident the glitching algorithms will be rewritten.

All the original javascript algorithms on which the initial build of this project is based was created by Felix Turner.
